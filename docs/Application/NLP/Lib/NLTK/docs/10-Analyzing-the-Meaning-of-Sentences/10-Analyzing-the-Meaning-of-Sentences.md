# [10. Analyzing the Meaning of Sentences](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch10.html)

We have seen how useful it is to harness the power of a computer to process text on a large scale. However, now that we have the machinery of parsers and feature based grammars, can we do anything similarly useful by analyzing the meaning of sentences? The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:

1. How can we represent natural language meaning so that a computer can process these **representations**?
2. How can we associate meaning representations with an unlimited set of sentences?
3. How can we use programs that connect the meaning representations of sentences to stores of knowledge?

Along the way we will learn some formal techniques in the field of logical semantics, and see how these can be used for interrogating databases that store facts about the world.
