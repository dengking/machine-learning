# 5.2 Capacity, Overfitting and Underfitting



The train and test data are generated by a probability distribution over datasets called the **data generating process** . We typically make a set of assumptions known collectively as the **i.i.d. assumptions** . These assumptions are that the examples in each dataset are **independent** from each other, and that the train set and test set are **identically distributed** , drawn from the same **probability distribution** as each other. This assumption allows us to describe the **data generating process** with a probability distribution over a single example. The same distribution is then used to generate every train example and every test example. We call that shared underlying distribution the **data generating distribution** , denoted $p_{data}$ . This probabilistic framework and the i.i.d. assumptions allow us to mathematically study the relationship between training error and test error.

关于**i.i.d. assumptions** ，参见[Independent and identically distributed random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables)。

“probability distribution”是[Probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)中的概念，它所指为[probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distributions)。所谓“**identically distributed**”，是指两种的[probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distributions)相同。
