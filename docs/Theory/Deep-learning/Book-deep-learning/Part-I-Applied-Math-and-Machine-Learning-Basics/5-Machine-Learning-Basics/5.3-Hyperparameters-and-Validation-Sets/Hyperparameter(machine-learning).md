# [Hyperparameter (machine learning)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning))

In [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), a **hyperparameter** is a [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter) whose value is set before the learning process begins. By contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via training.

Different model training algorithms require different hyperparameters, some simple algorithms (such as [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) regression) require none. Given these hyperparameters, the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data. For instance, [LASSO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LASSO) is an algorithm that adds a [regularization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)) hyperparameter to [ordinary least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) regression, which has to be set before estimating the parameters through the training algorithm.
