 Entity Linking (EL) is the task of recognizing (cf. [Named Entity Recognition](https://nlpprogress.com/english/named_entity_recognition.html)) and disambiguating (Named Entity Disambiguation) named entities to a knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, or YAGO). It is sometimes also simply known as Named Entity Recognition and Disambiguation. 

EL can be split into two classes of approaches:

- *End-to-End*: processing a piece of text to extract the entities (i.e. Named Entity Recognition) and then disambiguate（消除歧义） these extracted entities to the correct entry in a given knowledge base (e.g. Wikidata, DBpedia, YAGO).
- *Disambiguation-Only*: contrary to the first approach, this one directly takes gold standard named entities as input and only disambiguates them to the correct entry in a given knowledge base.
