# [Named entity recognition](http://nlpprogress.com/english/named_entity_recognition.html)

 **Named entity recognition** (NER) is the task of tagging（标记） **entities** in text with their corresponding type. Approaches typically use BIO notation（记号）, which differentiates the beginning (B) and the inside (I) of entities. O is used for non-entity tokens. 

Example:

| Mark  | Watney | visited | Mars  |
| ----- | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| B-PER | I-PER  | O       | B-LOC |
