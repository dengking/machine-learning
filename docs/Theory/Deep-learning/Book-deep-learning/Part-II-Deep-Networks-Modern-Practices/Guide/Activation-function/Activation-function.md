# [Activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)

In [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), the **activation function** of a node defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs. A standard [computer chip circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit) can be seen as a [digital network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) of activation functions that can be "ON" (1) or "OFF" (0), depending on input. This is similar to the behavior of the [linear perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_perceptron) in [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_networks). However, only *nonlinear* activation functions allow such networks to compute nontrivial problems using only a small number of nodes.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function#cite_note-1) In [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), this function is also called the [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function).
