# [Estimation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_theory)

**Estimation theory** is a branch of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) that deals with estimating the values of [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_parameter) based on measured empirical data that has a random component.  

An [estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator) attempts to approximate the unknown parameters using the measurements.

## [Estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator)

In [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), an **estimator** is a rule for calculating an estimate of a given quantity based on [observed data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics)): thus the rule (the estimator), the quantity of interest (the [estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand)) and its result (the estimate) are distinguished.

关于这几个概念的区分，参见下面[Estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand)。

## [Estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand)

An **estimand** is a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)) which is to be estimated in a statistical analysis. The term is used to more clearly distinguish the target of [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference) from the function to obtain this parameter (i.e., the [estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimator)) and the specific value obtained from a given data set (i.e., the [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimate)).

For instance, a [normally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)  random variable X has two variables, its mean $\mu$  and $\sigma ^{2}$. The variance estimator, $ s^{2}=\sum {i=1}^{n}\left.\left(x{i}-{\bar {x}}\right)^{2}\right/(n-1)$, yields an estimate of 7 for a data set $ x=\left\{2,3,7\right\}$; then $s^{2}$ is called an **estimator** of $\sigma ^{2}$, and $\sigma ^{2}$ is called the estimand.
