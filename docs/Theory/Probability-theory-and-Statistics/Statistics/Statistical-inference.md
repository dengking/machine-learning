# Statistical inference

统计推断。

本文是阅读维基百科[Statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference)的笔记。

**Statistical inference** is the process of using [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) to deduce properties of an underlying [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution).

这段话回答了statistical inference所“infer”的：properties of an underlying [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution)。我们假设研究的问题是存在着一个distribution的，我们通过[Statistical inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_inference)可以学习到这个distribution。

It is assumed that the observed data set is [sampled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)) from a larger population.

这是statistical inference的前提。

machine learning本质上是一种statistical inference。

## Introduction

Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of [sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)). Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of 

- (first) [selecting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_selection) a [statistical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model) of the process that generates the data 
- (second) deducing propositions from the model.

"The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling"

"How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis".
