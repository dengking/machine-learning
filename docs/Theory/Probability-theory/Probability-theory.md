**Probability theory** is the branch of [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) concerned with [probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability). Although there are several different [probability interpretations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations), probability theory treats the concept in a rigorous mathematical manner by expressing it through a set of [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axioms_of_probability)(公理). Typically these axioms formalise probability in terms of a [probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space), which assigns a [measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)) taking values between 0 and 1, termed the [probability measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_measure), to a set of outcomes called the [sample space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space). Any specified subset of these outcomes is called an [event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory)).

Central subjects in probability theory include discrete and continuous [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable), [probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distributions), and [stochastic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process), which provide mathematical abstractions of [non-deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) or uncertain processes or measured [quantities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity) that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in a random fashion.

Although it is not possible to perfectly predict **random** events, much can be said about their behavior. Two major results in probability theory describing such behaviour are the [law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers) and the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).

As a mathematical foundation for [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics), probability theory is essential to many human activities that involve **quantitative analysis** of data. Methods of probability theory also apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state, as in [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics). A great discovery of twentieth-century [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) was the probabilistic nature of physical phenomena at atomic scales, described in [quantuim mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics).

[Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf)的chapter 3.2 Random Variables：

A **random variable** is a variable that can take on different values randomly. Random variables may be discrete or continuous. A discrete random variable is one that has a finite or countably infinite number of states. Note that these states are not necessarily the integers; they can also just be named states that are not considered to have any numerical value. A continuous random variable is associated with a real value.

[Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/front_matter.pdf)的3.3 Probability Distributions:

A **probability distribution** is a description of how likely a **random variable** or set of random variables is to take on each of its possible states. The way we describe probability distributions depends on whether the variables are discrete or continuous.

A probability distribution over discrete variables may be described using a [probability mass function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_mass_function) (PMF).

When working with continuous random variables, we describe probability distributions using a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) (PDF) rather than a probability mass function.

对stochastic process的直观感受是它是一个数学模型，这个数学模型中涉及多个random variable。

维基百科[Stochastic process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process)：

In [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory) and related fields, a **stochastic** or **random process** is a [mathematical object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object) usually defined as a [family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_family) of [random variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). Historically, the **random variables** were associated with or indexed by a set of numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random) changing over [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time), such as the growth of a [bacterial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) population, an [electrical current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_current) fluctuating due to [thermal noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_noise), or the movement of a [gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas) [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule). Stochastic processes are widely used as [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_models) of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner.
